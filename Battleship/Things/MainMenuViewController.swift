I wasn't able to work at all over spring break and used my late days to get the game functional so I understand I will loose points for this. I will be meeting up with the TA this week to fix it for future assignments. I have 2 boards (arrays) and 2 move arrays to store with persistence. I would have saved every turn and loading them would have been as easy as assigning the models to the loaded ones from the plist. Sadly, I just couldn't get it to work! Thanks for grading :D", preferredStyle: UIAlertControllerStyle.alert)
