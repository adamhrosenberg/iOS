The MVC from my last project was pretty clunky and with just a lack of time with other classes on my end I wasn't able to make the needed changes to make this functional. I understand I will take a lower grade for this assignment. I was able to poll the server for a list of games, and include the games in the waiting state in 'Online Games'. From there you can successfully create a game with a game name and player name, but the next screen is not the actual game screen. If you click a game to join you join the game, and the board shows in the game view however the game is not playable from there. Since I cannot continue a game in progress really, it's pretty non working. However, when you click a cell when you join a game it does poll the server for the response however it's not your turn so you get a 400 error. The network code is in the battleship network class. Implementing the methods there happen in a variety of classes such as OnlineGameViewController, OneGamesViewController, and CreateGameViewController. I attempted to do as much as I could. I'm hoping to make up for this lower grade with my final project. Thank you!! ", preferredStyle: UIAlertControllerStyle.alert)

I wasn't able to work at all over spring break and used my late days to get the game functional so I understand I will loose points for this. I will be meeting up with the TA this week to fix it for future assignments. I have 2 boards (arrays) and 2 move arrays to store with persistence. I would have saved every turn and loading them would have been as easy as assigning the models to the loaded ones from the plist. Sadly, I just couldn't get it to work!
